# The statements

What is proved about the protocol `flock::quotient`, with every size discharged. The definitions
these theorems mention are in `Setup.lean`, which is short and has no proof in it.

**What is assumed.**
* The hash is a random oracle, used by this protocol only.
* The commitment is ideal. For soundness: binding, so a proof carries its polynomials, within
  the degrees its tables allow, and the oracle is asked about them. For zero knowledge: a
  commitment is a random handle and its openings reveal only whether the claims are true. These
  are two different idealizations, and no theorem here has both at once.

**What is not said.**
* That the circuit is the one of `flock::quotient`: the theorems are for every wiring and every
  weights, and with a degenerate circuit the relation holds of every statement. The Rust tests
  check that code's wiring is a permutation with no loop.
* That the Rust `reduce` is this verifier. `claims_iff_accepts_ofCantor` proves that four claims
  on committed tables, at given points with given values, are "accepts" here; that `reduce`
  forms those points and values is by review. The verifier here accepts more than Rust's, which
  also rejects a challenge `t` with some `1 + w_k(t) = 0`.
* That the honest proof is accepted in the game of `soundness`. `completeness` is in the game of
  zero knowledge, with random handles; `honest_messages_fit` shows the honest messages are
  objects `soundness` speaks of, and no more.
* That a witness over `K` of degree at most `2^20` exists for a given statement: it is a
  hypothesis of zero knowledge and completeness.
* Anything about the commitment the Rust code uses. Its tables are not padded and its roots are
  deterministic, so the zero knowledge theorem does not apply to it as built.
* The adversary of `soundness` has no coins of its own; zero knowledge is for one proof, with a
  simulator that writes in the oracle's table and is not shown efficient.
