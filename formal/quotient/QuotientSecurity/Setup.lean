# The setting of the statements

The definitions `Statement.lean` is written on: the circuit, the relation, what a proof is, and
the two experiments of zero knowledge. Three things carry the meaning of the theorems and are
defined elsewhere, where they should be read:

* what the verifier checks: `Params.Accepts` (`Protocol.lean`), run against the oracle by
  `verify` and `experiment` (`RandomOracle.lean`);
* the honest prover: `realNI`, `proverRO`, `viewAt` (`NonInteractive.lean`), on the masked
  polynomials `committed` (`Simulation.lean`);
* the simulator: `simNI` (`NonInteractive.lean`), which draws its values with `simValues`
  (`ZeroKnowledge.lean`) and reads the statement, the oracle's state and public polynomials.

/-- **A circuit**: `2^20` rows of four cells, a cell being named by 22 bits. Its points are the
span of a Cantor basis, `wiring` says which cells must be equal, and `c k` is the weight that bit
`k < 8` of a cell's index gives it in a public word. The theorems hold for every circuit, and
mean what the circuit makes them mean: with the identity wiring and zero weights, every statement
has a satisfying assignment. They are about `flock::quotient` when the wiring and the weights are
that circuit's, which Lean does not check. -/

/-- **The relation**, on an assignment `w` of a field element to every cell. `cellBits (y, r)` is
the cell of row `y` with role `r` (`X`, `Y`, `C`, `V`): bits 0 and 1 of a cell are its role, the
other twenty its row.

1. Every row satisfies the gate: on elements of `GF(4)`, read as a bit and a carry, it says the
   `V` cell holds the sum bit and the carry out of the bits of `X`, `Y` and the carry of `C`.
2. Cells wired together are equal.
3. Each public word is the weighted sum of its cells: word `J` reads the cells whose bits 8 to
   10 spell `J` and whose bits from 11 on are zero, each with the product of `c k` over its set
   bits `k < 8`.

The cells are arbitrary field elements. That they are elements of `GF(4)`, inputs being bits, is
a consequence and not a hypothesis: `cells_determined` (`Circuit.lean`) proves it for a wiring
with no loop whose zero and one are pinned by public words. -/

/-! ## Soundness: proofs and adversaries

The commitment is ideal and binding: a proof carries its polynomials, and the random oracle is
asked about them directly. -/

/-- **A statement with a proof of it.** `stmt`: eight words. `g`: the first message, four
polynomials of degree at most `2^21`. `R`: the second, five polynomials of degree at most
`2^24`: the sum's polynomial in two parts, the two quotients, and a fifth that shares their
table and that an honest prover leaves zero. `v`: five field elements. These degrees are what
the tables can hold, rounded up. -/

The commitment is ideal and its openings reveal nothing: a commitment is a handle drawn at
random in `H`, and of the four claims the experiments output only whether they are true. -/
